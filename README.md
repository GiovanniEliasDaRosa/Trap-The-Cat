### Languages Used

| Language   | %    |
| ---------- | ---- |
| JavaScript | 64.5 |
| CSS        | 27.1 |
| HTML       | 8.4  |

As this is a game, most of the work is done through JS.

## How the game was done

I was challenged by my other friend called **Beatriz** who said if I could make a game like [Trap The Cat on (https://trapthecat.io)](https://trapthecat.io), where the idea was to trap the cat and don't let him escape. Then I accepted the idea and in about 2 months later I had the game entirely done.

Initially I started the project by myself, then my friend **Paolo** liked the idea and started to help me to get the game done.

### Dividing Work

- **Beatriz**
  - Had the idea
- **Paolo**
  - Had the logic
- **Me**
  - Developed the JavaScript code
  - Created the HTML and CSS files
  - Designed pixel art assets
  - Produced the sound

Essentially, my friend provided the overall logic, and I actively translated it into pseudocode before ultimately transforming it into JavaScript code.

## About Me

I made games in the [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) before this, so I had some experience with game dev.
